# Broken App Issues
## Issues with Original Code

1. **Asynchronous Handling:**
   - The original code used `Array.prototype.map` to handle asynchronous operations but did not use `Promise.all`, leading to unresolved promises.

2. **Error Handling:**
   - The `catch` block did not define `err`, resulting in improper error handling.

3. **Body Parsing Middleware:**
   - The code did not include middleware to parse JSON request bodies, causing issues with handling POST requests.

4. **Response Format:**
   - The code used `res.send(JSON.stringify(out))` instead of `res.json(out)`, which is less ideal for sending JSON responses.

5. **Validation:**
   - There was no validation to check if the `developers` array was provided and non-empty, leading to potential errors when processing requests.

## Solution

- **Asynchronous Handling:** Utilized `Promise.all` to handle multiple asynchronous requests properly.
- **Error Handling:** Improved error handling with detailed error messages and proper error propagation.
- **Body Parsing Middleware:** Added `bodyParser.json()` to parse incoming JSON request bodies.
- **Response Format:** Used `res.json()` for sending JSON responses.
- **Validation:** Added validation to ensure the `developers` array is present and non-empty.
