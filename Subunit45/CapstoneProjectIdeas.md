Project Ideas

My first optoin is a News api to Get and search for news from over 30,000 publications with this simple and free (for non commercial projects) API, specifically the Top Headlines from TechCrunch
https://newsapi.org/v2/top-headlines?sources=techcrunch&apiKey=API_KEY

My second option is the Spotify api which i like the most.
--request GET \
    'https://api.spotify.com/v1/tracks/2TpxZ7JUBn3uw46aR7qd6V' \
     --header "Authorization: Bearer NgCXRK...MzYjw"
     
I think ill choose The Spotify API! It offers a rich dataset and many possibilities for interactive features. Some ideas for how to use it in the Capstone Project:
Music Discovery App: Users can search for artists, tracks, and albums, with suggestions for similar artists based on what they search for.
Playlist Builder: Users can create and save custom playlists by searching for songs, artists, or albums.
Music Stats Dashboard: A personalized dashboard that shows users stats on their favorite songs, genres, or artists, using Spotify's metadata.


my third option is a Youtube api that allows developers to acess video statistics and YOutube channels data via two types of calls rest and xml-prc.
