Stack
Focus

Is the front-end UI or the back-end going to be the focus of your
project? Or are you going to make an evenly focused full-stack
application?

This will be a full-stack application, with equal emphasis on both the front-end user experience and the back-end data handling and integration with the Spotify API.
Frontend: React
Backend: Node.js/Express
Database: MongoDB or PostgreSQL (if you want to store user data or custom playlist data)
API Integration: Spotify Web API

Type
Will this be a website? A mobile app? Something else?

This will be a web application accessible from any modern web browser.

Goal
What goal will your project be designed to achieve?

The goal is to create a user-friendly application where users can search and explore Spotify playlists, view detailed statistics on their favorite tracks, artists, and albums, and discover new music based on playlist data.

Users
What kind of users will visit your app? In other words, what is
the demographic of your users?

The target demographic includes music enthusiasts who want a deeper insight into their favorite playlists, Spotify users looking to discover new music, and anyone interested in exploring music trends and statistics.

Data
What data do you plan on using? How are you planning on
collecting your data? You may have not picked your actual API
yet, which is fine, just outline what kind of data you would like it
to contain. You are welcome to create your own API and
populate it with data.

Data Source: Spotify Web API
I will collect data such as:
Playlist information (title, description, cover image)
Track details (name, artist, album, duration)
Artist details (name, genre, popularity)
Album information (release date, total tracks, cover art)
By using the Spotify API, i'll be able to gather this data in real-time, allowing for up-to-date information.
